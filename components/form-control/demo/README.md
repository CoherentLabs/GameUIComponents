# How to start the demo?

1. If you don't have express installed do `npm i express -g` or `npm i express`.
2. In the `demo` directory do `node server.js`.
3. Open `demo.html` inside the player or inside chrome and play around.

The server should log GET and POST requests in the console and the demo will log the data that is submited from each form after the request finished on submit.
