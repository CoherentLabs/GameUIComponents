All components can also be used in Google Chrome. You can preview them by starting the demo. You can serve the root directory and open the demo.html file using an http-server of your choice. Or use the default setup in the package. All components are npm packages available in the npm registry. Use npm i coherent-gameface-\u0026lt;component-name\u0026gt; to install any of them. You can also build them from source.\nRunning the Demo # Navigate to the root directory and run:\nnpm install\r This will install a webpack server as well as all other dependencies. After that run:\nnpm run build\r This will build all components. After that run:\nnpm run start:demo\r This will serve the files on http://localhost:8080. Load that url in the Gameface player or in Chrome and preview the components. You can change the port in the webpack.config.js file.\nSamples # The samples are more complex examples of how to create a complete user interface using the components. They are located in samples/user_interface. There are three pages - main, settings and shop. To run any of them navigate to their folder an run npm i to install the dependencies. After that load the *.html file in Chrome. Keep in mind that each page has a link to one of the others and if you haven\u0026rsquo;t installed the dependencies there, it will not work as expected. To avoid this make sure you execute npm i in all folders.\nAvailable Commands # These are the commands used to build and package the components.\n   Command Description Arguments Usage     rebuild Do a clean install of all dependencies and build everything. N/A npm run rebuild   build Build all components - create their demo, umd and cjs bundles. \u0026ndash;no-install -ni, \u0026ndash;library npm run build -- --no-install --library   build:demo Build only the demos of all components. N/A npm run build:demo   build:library Build only the components library. N/A npm run build:library   build:dev Build the components using only the local packages. Will install dependencies only from source, not the npm registry. N/A npm run build:dev   build:documentation Build the components, the demos and the documentation. \u0026ndash;rebuild, \u0026ndash;component npm run build:documentation -- --component checkbox, npm run build:documentation -- --rebuild   check:copyright Will check the files inside the components folder for copyright notice. N/A npm run check:copyright   add:copyright Will add copyright notice to files inside the components folder that are missing it. N/A npm run add:copyright   start:demo Serve the demo project. N/A npm run start:demo   test Start Karma server on localhost:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/debug.html N/A npm run test   test:Chrome Start Karma server and run the tests in Google Chrome. N/A npm run test:Chrome   pack Bundle the components to npm packages ready for publish. N/A npm run pack   pack:library Create npm package of the component library. N/A npm run pack:library   link Create links for all components to test with local packages only1. N/A npm run link   unlink Remove all global links that exist for components. To remove the local packages use npm run clean. N/A npm run link   clean Remove all existing bundles, packages and installed dependencies. N/A npm run clean    After you successfully execute npm run tests open the Gameface player or Chrome with \u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;url=http://localhost:9876/debug.html\u0026rdquo; to see the tests running.\nBuilding from source # To build the components from this repository use the npm run build:dev command. This will:\n create symlinks for all components build all components and their demos NPM will use the links to install the dependencies, not the public npm packages. This means that if a component depends on another, the dependency will be installed from the source, making it easy to test local changes. For example - the dropdown component depends on the scrollable container. If you make changes to the scrollable-container and run npm run build:dev you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to observe the changes that you did to the scrollable-container in the demo of dropdown, because it uses the local package created by the build:dev command. If you inspect the scrollable-container package located in the dropdown\u0026rsquo;s node_modules you\u0026rsquo;ll see that it is a symbolic link that references the source of the scrollable container located in the components folder.  The npm run build:dev command will build all components. If you are not changing all of them you don\u0026rsquo;t need to rebuild them every time. You can build individual components using the coherent game UI components CLI. This is a command line tool that enables you to create, build and watch for changes, making the development iterations faster and easier. You can read more about it in the documentation.\nAfter you install it, navigate to a component, for example components/dropdown and run: coherent-guic-cli build Make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve installed the dependencies before that using either npm run build:dev, npm i or npm run link Refer to the commands table for more info on each command.\nCreating new components # All components are npm modules. Your component doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be an npm module. If you need to use it in your project only, you can skip the steps which make a component an npm module. However if at some point you decide that you want to make your component an npm module - follow the steps below to see how to do it.\nStructure of a Component # All Gameface JavaScript components are custom HTML elements. Each component has:\n a JavaScript source file - the custom element\u0026rsquo;s definition; where all the logic is implemented a JavaScript index file - the entry file an HTML file - the component\u0026rsquo;s template; a CSS file - the component\u0026rsquo;s styles a package.json file a README markdown file - short documentation explaining what the component does and how it\u0026rsquo;s used a demo folder - folder containing an example of the component  Using without bundling # If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to add your component to the GameUIComponent suite you can use it without building and packaging it as npm module. However, you\u0026rsquo;ll still have to use the components library as dependency. Initialize an npm project using\nnpm init\r and install the components library:\nnpm i coherent-gameface-components\r After that create an index.html and index.js files. Import the components library and the component\u0026rsquo;s definition file using script tag:\n\u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;node_modules/coherent-gameface-components/umd/components.development.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;script.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\r Add the custom component to the page:\n\u0026lt;gameface-checkbox\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/\u0026lt;gameface-checkbox\u0026gt;\r The JavaScript definition is a simple class which extends the HTMLElement. The template can be loaded asynchronously using XHR. Set the URL member of the component in the constructor to load the template via XHR.\nUsing XHR\nclass Checkbox extends BaseComponent {\rconstructor() {\rsuper();\r// the URL specifies the path to the template file\rthis.url = '/components/checkbox/template.html';\r}\r}\r Use the loadResource method from the components library to load the template:\nclass Checkbox extends BaseComponent {\rconnectedCallback() {\rcomponents.loadResource(this)\r.then(this.init)\r.catch(err =\u0026gt; console.error(err));\r}\r}\r The setupTemplate method internally checks if the custom element is still connected to the DOM and ready to be used. Its first argument is data - the result returned from the loadResource method. Its second parameter is a callback that will be executed if the checks in the setup template were successful. If they were not - you\u0026rsquo;ll see a message in the debugger console - \u0026lsquo;DEBUG: component Checkbox was not initialized because it was disconnected from the DOM!\u0026rsquo;. Make sure to call the renderOnce(this); method of the components library in the setupTemplate callback. This will attach the template to the custom component replacing all slots with their slottable items (if there are any). Here is also where you should define custom members or event listeners.\nclass Checkbox extends BaseComponent {\rinit(data) {\rthis.setupTemplate(data, () =\u0026gt; {\rcomponents.renderOnce(this);\r// init members and event listeners here\rthis.addEventListener('click', this.toggleChecked);\rthis.checked = this.hasAttribute('checked');\rthis.disabled = this.disabled ? true : false;\r});\r}\rconnectedCallback() {\rcomponents.loadResource(this)\r.then(this.init)\r.catch(err =\u0026gt; console.error(err));\r}\r}\r Here\u0026rsquo;s the full example of a custom Checkbox component:\nclass Checkbox extends BaseComponent {\rconstructor() {\rsuper();\rthis.url = '/components/checkbox/template.html';\r}\rinit(data) {\rthis.setupTemplate(data, () =\u0026gt; {\rcomponents.renderOnce(this);\r// init members and event listeners here\rthis.addEventListener('click', this.toggleChecked);\rthis.checked = this.hasAttribute('checked');\rthis.disabled = (this.disabled) ? true : false;\r});\r}\rconnectedCallback() {\rcomponents.loadResource(this)\r.then(this.init)\r.catch(err =\u0026gt; console.error(err));\r}\rcomponents.defineCustomElement('gameface-checkbox', Checkbox);\r}\r Use the \u0026lt;link\u0026gt; tags to import style files.\n\u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;../coherent-gameface-components-theme.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;../style.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r To test the component start an http server at the root and open index.html. If you use http-server go to /checkbox and run:\nhttp-server\r Navigate to localhost:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt; and check your component.\nAdding component to the components suite # If you want to contribute to the components library and add a new component you need to add the required files in the correct folders. Make sure they can be successfully bundled and are documented.\n All components are placed in the /components folder. The folders are named using lower case and camel-case for longer names. All names should be prefixed with gameface- - gameface-some-component instead of some-component  components.defineCustomElement('gameface-some-component', SomeComponent);\nNote that only the name of the custom element and the name of the npm package in package.json must be prefixed.\nYou can use the coherent-guic-cli to build a single component. Follow the steps bellow to see how to manually build all components if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use the CLI.\nThe build command generates UMD and CJS bundles of the component. The module bundler that is used is Rollup. That means we can use import and export statements and rollup will automatically resolve all modules. Now we can import all dependencies at the top of the script.js file:\nimport components from 'coherent-gameface-components';\rimport template from './template.html';\r And we can export the checkbox at the bottom:\nexport { Checkbox };\r This example uses module loader to import the template - set the template as a property of the component:\nthis.template = template;\r The loadResource method can work both with URL and an imported template. You can conveniently switch between XHR and the imported template as the syntax is the same. This is how the component\u0026rsquo;s definition looks like:\nimport components from 'coherent-gameface-components';\rimport template from './template.html';\rclass Checkbox extends BaseComponent {\rconstructor() {\rsuper();\rthis.template = template;\r}\rinit(data) {\rthis.setupTemplate(data, () =\u0026gt; {\rcomponents.renderOnce(this);\r// init members and event listeners here\rthis.addEventListener('click', this.toggleChecked);\rthis.checked = this.hasAttribute('checked');\rthis.disabled = this.disabled ? true : false;\r});\r}\rconnectedCallback() {\rcomponents.loadResource(this)\r.then(this.init)\r.catch(err =\u0026gt; console.error(err));\r}\rcomponents.defineCustomElement('gameface-checkbox', Checkbox);\rexport { Checkbox };\r}\rCheck the [full implementation](https://github.com/CoherentLabs/GameUIComponents/blob/master/components/checkbox/script.js) and the [demo](https://github.com/CoherentLabs/GameUIComponents/tree/master/components/checkbox/demo) on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/CoherentLabs/GameUIComponents/tree/master/components/checkbox)\rBecause all components are npm packages you need to add an entry index.js file. This is the file that would be loaded when you import your component from node_modules like this:\r```javascript\rimport { Checkbox } from 'gameface-checkbox';\r It should export either the development or the production CJS bundle:\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\rmodule.exports = require('./cjs/checkbox.production.min.js');\r} else {\rmodule.exports = require('./cjs/checkbox.development.js');\r}\r Each component has a demo page. It is located in a /demo folder. Bundle the JavaScript file of the demo to make sure it can directly work in the browser. The demo.js file imports all dependencies and Rollup can resolves and bundles them.\nimport components from 'coherent-gameface-components';\rimport checkbox from '../umd/checkbox.development.js'\r The demo.html file should import the bundle.js and use the custom element:\n\u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;gameface-checkbox\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/gameface-checkbox\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;./bundle.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;\r Note that the demo files should have the names demo.js and demo.html for the JavaScript and html files respectively. Make sure all files have the LICENSE notice at the top. Run npm run add:copyright to automatically add copyright notice to all files.\nTo build the component run:\nnpm run rebuild\r The newly created bundles are located in checkbox/umd and checkbox/cjs folders. To test if everything works open the demo.html file.\nIf everything works, add a README.md file to the component folder and add a documentation page to the docs/ folder.\nAdding styles # The styles of a component are located in the same location as its source in a style.css file. You can use different file name and folder structure if it makes sense. For example the styles of the slider component are located in a separate folder and they have names corresponding to the type of slider they style. Make sure to prefix all selectors with guic- to avoid overwriting global selectors with common names. The prefix is an abbreviation of Game UI Components. Import the styles using a link tag in the file where you use the custom component:\n\u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;style.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r Adding flexibility through slots # The  HTML element is a placeholder inside a web component that you can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM trees and present them together. This component system provides a custom element called  which replaces the standard  element, but keeps the main idea. Slots are usable in cases where a dynamic content must be placed in a specific place in the HTML.

For example the dropdown component has a scrollable-container (another component) in its template and all options (list items) of the dropdown, which are passed through slots as they are dynamic go into the scrollable container:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;dropdown\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;dropdown-header\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;selected\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Select an option\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;custom-select-arrow\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;options-container hidden\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;gameface-scrollable-container class=\u0026quot;scrollable-container-component\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div slot=\u0026quot;scrollable-content\u0026quot; data-name=\u0026quot;scrollable-content\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;options\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;!--all options go here--\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;component-slot data-name=\u0026quot;option\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/component-slot\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/gameface-scrollable-container\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r The usage of the component looks a lot simpler:\n\u0026lt;gameface-dropdown class=\u0026quot;gameface-dropdown-component\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dropdown-option slot=\u0026quot;option\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Cat1\u0026lt;/dropdown-option\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dropdown-option slot=\u0026quot;option\u0026quot; disabled\u0026gt;Cat1\u0026lt;/dropdown-option\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dropdown-option slot=\u0026quot;option\u0026quot; disabled\u0026gt;Cat1\u0026lt;/dropdown-option\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dropdown-option slot=\u0026quot;option\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Cat3\u0026lt;/dropdown-option\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/gameface-dropdown\u0026gt;\r And when the component is rendered and all elements are slotted the final markup will look like this:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;dropdown\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;dropdown-header\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;selected\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Select an option\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;custom-select-arrow\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;options-container hidden\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;gameface-scrollable-container class=\u0026quot;scrollable-container-component\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div slot=\u0026quot;scrollable-content\u0026quot; data-name=\u0026quot;scrollable-content\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;options\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dropdown-option slot=\u0026quot;option\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Cat1\u0026lt;/dropdown-option\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dropdown-option slot=\u0026quot;option\u0026quot; disabled\u0026gt;Cat1\u0026lt;/dropdown-option\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dropdown-option slot=\u0026quot;option\u0026quot; disabled\u0026gt;Cat1\u0026lt;/dropdown-option\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dropdown-option slot=\u0026quot;option\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Cat3\u0026lt;/dropdown-option\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/gameface-scrollable-container\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r Testing # All tests are located in tools/tests. For more information on how to create and run a test refer to the documentation.\nPublishing components to npm # Before you publish make sure:\n The component builds - the umd and cjs packages are successfully generated. All tests pass. There is a README.md with useful information about how to use the component. The name of the component is correct (prefixed with coherent-gameface-). The demo is bundled. There is a public documentation committed in the docs folder. Add the rest of the team\u0026rsquo;s npm accounts to collaborators using the npm owners add command or through npmjs.com.  Manually update the version of the component in package.json and run\nnpm publish\nComponents style guide # To prevent errors, improve the code quality and readability, to make maintainable and consistent code we decided to add a style guide to the repository. We defined all the rules by setting an eslinter that will force all the developers to respect the style guide when developing JavaScript features. To make sure that \u0026ldquo;clean\u0026rdquo; code is committed we added additional actions:\n We added a pre-commit hook that is set up by the husky and load-staged modules. When committing changes the hook will run the linter on the staged files to make sure everything is fine. If the lint check fails the commit will be discarded so the errors be fixed first. When the errors are fixed you can try again to make a commit. To fix all the errors from the lint check you can run npm run lint:fix. Make sure that they are correctly fixed! If you want to check anytime if you have some linter errors you can run npm run lint:errors. If you want to check for warnings as well you can run npm run lint:all. We advise you to use lint:all command! You can install a VSCode extension that will run the linter in the background while you are coding. This will save you time fixing the errors at the end. We added a GitHub action that will be triggered when you make a pull request. It will run the linter each time you make a change to the pull request to make sure everything is fine with the code.  Configuring the Python environment # Currently, we still rely on Python2.7 for the execution of our scripts. This means that if you get weird errors, you probably have to double-check if you have Python2.7 installed on your system.\nIn case you have previously installed Python3 only, to ensure that when python is called in a console environment, you must make sure that your Python2 installation location is included in your Path environment variable before the Python3 installation.\nAlso, a common way to be able to call both Python2 and Python3 executions of scripts is to navigate to your Python3 install location (after configuring the Path environment variable as described above) and symlink your python.exe in the same directory and name it python3.exe. This way you will be able to easily call a script like so - python3 somescript.py - and let it be executed by Python3\nYou can also opt for a virtualenv setup.\nUpdate versions in the package.json files of components # When you update a component or the component library source then you need to bump the version in the package.json so they can be published automatically. However, some components depend on others so you need to bump the component dependencies versions as well.\nBecause we are using the ^ notation, updating the dependencies versions should be done when you do a major version update of the main package because it won\u0026rsquo;t be backward compatible anymore. Check the next sections for examples.\nWhen you don\u0026rsquo;t need to update the dependencies versions # Patch update # {\r\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;coherent-gameface-components\u0026quot;,\r- \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.4.0\u0026quot;\r+ \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.4.1\u0026quot;\r}\r {\r\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;coherent-gameface-slider\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.3.0\u0026quot;\r...\r\u0026quot;dependencies\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;coherent-gameface-components\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^1.4.0\u0026quot;\r}\r}\r In this case, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to update the coherent-gameface-components dependency in the gameface-slider package.json file because npm i will install the latest minor or patch version of the components library.\nMinor update # {\r\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;coherent-gameface-components\u0026quot;,\r- \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.4.0\u0026quot;\r+ \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.5.0\u0026quot;\r}\r {\r\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;coherent-gameface-slider\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.3.0\u0026quot;\r...\r\u0026quot;dependencies\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;coherent-gameface-components\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^1.4.0\u0026quot;\r}\r}\r In this case, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to update the coherent-gameface-components dependency in the gameface-slider package.json file because npm i will install the latest minor or patch version of the components library.\nMajor update # {\r\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;coherent-gameface-components\u0026quot;,\r- \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.4.0\u0026quot;\r+ \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2.0.0\u0026quot;\r}\r {\r\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;coherent-gameface-slider\u0026quot;,\r- \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.3.0\u0026quot;\r+ \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2.0.0\u0026quot;\r...\r\u0026quot;dependencies\u0026quot;: {\r- \u0026quot;coherent-gameface-components\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^1.4.0\u0026quot;\r+ \u0026quot;coherent-gameface-components\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^2.0.0\u0026quot;\r}\r}\r In this case, you need to update the coherent-gameface-components dependency in the slider package.json file because it is a major update and it is not backwards compatible.\nAlso see that here the version of the slider is updated as well!\nAuto update versions # Instead of manually updating all the versions of the dependencies when you have a major update you can directly use the update-versions.js script for that purpose.\nTo use it first change the major version of all the modules that are updated (coherent-gameface-component for example as above) and then run npm run update-versions in the repo root.\nThe script is going to check all the new updated versions and then iterate through all the components and reflect the update in the version of the dependencies as it is done manually here.\n  The components will not use the local packages created from source, not the ones from the npm registry. Useful when you are doing changes the core library or to any of the existing components and you want to test your changes. Remember to build with the \u0026ndash;no-install option when using links as otherwise the build will perform npm install which will overwrite the links.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "},{"id":20,"href":"/GameUIComponents/en/api-ref/components-library/","title":"Components library","content":"Classes #  BaseComponent BaseComponent The base class from which all other components inherit shared logic\n Validator This is the base class that holds all functionality shared between custom components and native elements\n NativeElementValidator The NativeElementValidator uses the methods from the Validator class All native elements tha don\u0026#39;t support methods like isFormElement, tooLong, tooShort etc.. will be wrapped in this class in order to enable us to validate native and custom elements using the same methods.\n CustomElementValidator The CustomElementValidator is inherited by custom elements in order to gain the validation function from the Validator class.

If you would like to have a dropdown that looks like a single select, but supports multiple selected elements - add the collapsable attribute along with the multiple attribute:\n\u0026lt;gameface-dropdown class=\u0026quot;gameface-dropdown-component\u0026quot; multiple collapsable\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dropdown-option\u0026gt;Cat1\u0026lt;/dropdown-option\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dropdown-option\u0026gt;Parrot\u0026lt;/dropdown-option\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/gameface-dropdown\u0026gt;  Features and Limitations # This is not a standard HTML select multiple. It is a custom HTML element that enables you to define a list of options.\n The multiple attribute makes it possible to select more than one option using the Ctrl key and the mouse.  All options can be selected with Ctrl + A combination.   Set the disabled attribute to gameface-dropdown or a dropdown-option to disable it. Set the selected attribute to any dropdown-option to pre-select it.  These are some of the differences to the standard select that are partially or not yet supported:\n Selecting multiple options via keyboard - this is possible with Shift + Arrow Up/Left/Down/Right and Shift + Home/End. Selecting a range of elements.  Supported Attributes # You can modify the dropdown and its options using HTML attributes. The gameface-dropdown supports:\n multiple - makes the dropdown multiple, enabling selecting more than one option collapsable - specifies if the options' list should be always visible disabled - makes the dropdown disabled  The dropdown-option supports:\n value - sets a custom value to the option different from its text content selected - makes an option selected disabled - disables an option  Note that attempting to remove an attribute from an option that does not have this attribute will have no effect! For example an option could be selected and not have the selected attribute, as selecting an option using the mouse will update only its internal selected property.\nTo add or remove an attribute use the setAttribute or the removeAttribute method.\nAdd the Styles # \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;coherent-gameface-components-theme.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;style.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;node_modules/coherent-gameface-scrollable-container/style.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;node_modules/coherent-gameface-slider/styles/horizontal.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;node_modules/coherent-gameface-slider/styles/vertical.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt;  To overwrite the default styles, simply create new rules for the class names that you wish to change and include them after the default styles.\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/GameUIComponents/en/examples/dropdown/","title":"Dropdown","content":"   body { background-color: transparent; } .page-wrapper { height: 45vh; } .page-wrapper .guic-dropdown-selected-option { background-color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 0.1); } [data-dark-mode] .page-wrapper .guic-dropdown-selected-option { background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3); color: #dee2e6; } [data-dark-mode] dropdown-option:not([disabled]) { color: #dee2e6; } [data-dark-mode] dropdown-option { color: rgb(87, 87, 87); } .page-wrapper .guic-dropdown-option-active { background-color: var(--default-color-blue); } .guic-dropdown-option-active { background-color: transparent; } .guic-scrollable-container-wrapper { width: 100%; height: 200px; } .guic-vertical-slider-wrapper { height: 200px; } gameface-dropdown { line-height: 100%; } [data-dark-mode] dropdown-option, [data-dark-mode] .guic-dropdown-options { background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); }    Cat1 Cat1 Cat1 Cat3 Cat4 Dog Giraffe Lion Pig Eagle Parrot Last Parrot Last Parrota Last Parrot      "},{"id":23,"href":"/GameUIComponents/en/examples/","title":"Examples","content":""},{"id":24,"href":"/GameUIComponents/en/components/form-control/","title":"Form control","content":"\nThe gameface-form-control is part of the Gameface custom components suite.

is a component that allows you to use a text input of different types - text, email, password, number, etc. It supports validation. For example, if you create a text field with the type:\n email - the built-in validation will check if the value has a @ symbol and it will show an error if does not. url - the built-in validation will check a pattern as an attribute to the text field and its value should match this pattern. For example if the url should match certain domain name - \u0026lt;gameface-text-field type=\u0026quot;url\u0026quot; pattern=\u0026quot;mydomain.*\u0026quot;\u0026gt;. password - the built-in validation will check length through the minlength and maxlength attributes. number - the built-in validation will check min and max attributes. text, password, search - the built-in validation will check length through the minlength and maxlength attributes.  Example # \u0026lt;gameface-form-control style=\u0026quot;position: absolute;top: 200px;\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-text-field id=\u0026quot;text\u0026quot; name=\u0026quot;text\u0026quot; label=\u0026quot;User name:\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;text\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;thisisvalid\u0026quot; minlength=\u0026quot;5\u0026quot; maxlength=\u0026quot;20\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/gameface-text-field\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-text-field id=\u0026quot;url\u0026quot; name=\u0026quot;url\u0026quot; pattern=\u0026quot;https://.*\u0026quot; label=\u0026quot;Website:\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;https://localhost:9090\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;url\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/gameface-text-field\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-text-field id=\u0026quot;email\u0026quot; name=\u0026quot;email\u0026quot; label=\u0026quot;Email:\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;email\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;text-field@test.com\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/gameface-text-field\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-text-field id=\u0026quot;number\u0026quot; name=\u0026quot;number\u0026quot; label=\u0026quot;Age:\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;number\u0026quot; min=\u0026quot;15\u0026quot; max=\u0026quot;200\u0026quot; step=\u0026quot;10\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;30\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/gameface-text-field\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button class=\u0026quot;form-element\u0026quot; id=\u0026quot;submit\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;submit\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Login\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/gameface-form-control\u0026gt;  Validation # The form control supports validation. These are the attributes that you can use:\n   Name Purpose Supported Elements     required Used to indicate that a value is required. Will show an error if the element doesn\u0026rsquo;t have value. Input, Textarea, Checkbox, Switch, Radio Button   minlength Used to indicate the minimum length of a text field. Input   maxlength Used to indicate the minimum length of a text field. Input   min Used to indicate the minimum value of a number input Input   max Used to indicate the maximum value of a number input Input   pattern Used to specify a url pattern. TextField[type=\u0026ldquo;url\u0026rdquo;]   required Used to specify that the element must have value. All form supported elements    Custom validation # The form control component supports custom validation as well. Its purpose is to customize the default methods for validation, error messages, or where to show them. The default methods for validating form are stored in a map where each method has a default message defined for it. These methods are checking if a form element meets the requirements to be valid that are defined by the attributes above. Here is a table describing each method name, its error, and its relevant form element attribute.\n   Default validator method name Error message Corresponding attribute Additional info     notAForm This element is not part of a form. N/A This validator validates if the element is part of the form control.   nameMissing The element does not have a name attribute and will not be submitted N/A This validator validates if a form element has valid name attribute set.   tooLong The value is too long. Maximum length is ${element.getAttribute('maxlength')}. maxlength    tooShort The value is too short. Minimal length is ${element.getAttribute('minlength')}. minlength    rangeOverflow The value is too big. Maximum is ${element.getAttribute('max')}. max    rangeUnderflow The value is too small. Minimum is ${element.getAttribute('min')}. min    valueMissing The value is required. required    badURL Please enter a valid URL. It should match the following pattern: /${element.pattern}/. N/A This validator validates \u0026lt;gameface-text-field\u0026gt; component\u0026rsquo;s value when its type is url.   badEmail Please enter a valid email. It should contain a @ symbol. N/A This validator validates \u0026lt;gameface-text-field\u0026gt; component\u0026rsquo;s value when its type is email.    As you can see some validators have error messages that include some properties from the validated element. That is because each validator dynamically constructs the error messages using the currently validated form element.\nCustom form validation methods # \u0026lt;gameface-form-control\u0026gt; component has some methods for making custom validation possible.\n   Method Arguments Description     setCustomValidators (name: string, validators: ValidatorsConfig) Will set custom defined validators related to the form elements with the corresponding name attribute.   removeCustomValidator (name: string) Will remove any custom validators related to the form element with the corresponding name attribute.   removeCustomValidators (names: string[]) Same as the removeCustomValidator but works with multiple names.   setCustomDisplayErrorElement (name: string, selector: string) Will change the default behavior of showing error messages. The name argument specifies the form element that will be modified. The selector specifies the element in which the error will be displayed.   removeCustomDisplayErrorElement (name: string) Remove the custom error message element previously added using setCustomDisplayErrorElement. The name argument specifies the form element. The default tooltip will be used instead for displaying errors.   removeCustomDisplayErrorElements (names: string[]) Same as the removeCustomDisplayErrorElement method but works with multiple names.    ValidatorsConfig # It is an object that has the following type:\ninterface ValidatorsConfig { [ValidatorName: string]: { method?: (element: HTMLElement) =\u0026gt; boolean | Promise\u0026lt;boolean\u0026gt; errorMessage?: (element: HTMLElement) =\u0026gt; string } }  With the ValidatorName key you define your custom validator name or you can use some of the default validator names to overwrite their behavior.\nmethod is the function that is used to tell the form component if the currently validated element is valid. It receives that element and should return a boolean with the result about the validity of the element. You can use the async function to define the method property. To overwrite the default validators use ValidatorName that has the same name as the one you wish to change:\nform.setCustomValidators('username', { valueMissing: { // will use this one, no the default method: (element) =\u0026gt; !element.value, errorMessage: () =\u0026gt; 'The username is required! ' } })  errorMessage is the function that constructs the message if the validation of the form element fails. It receives that element so you can extract its attributes and return a more specific error message. The function should return a string. If this property is added to ValidatorName that is some of the default ones will overwrite the default validation message.\nform.setCustomValidators('username', { valueMissing: { errorMessage: () =\u0026gt; 'The username is required! ' // will use this error message, not the default that is \u0026quot;The value is required.\u0026quot; } })  Example # Let us have the following form defined\n\u0026lt;gameface-form-control id=\u0026quot;custom-validation-form\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-text-field name=\u0026quot;username\u0026quot; label=\u0026quot;User name:\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;text\u0026quot; minlength=\u0026quot;5\u0026quot; maxlength=\u0026quot;20\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/gameface-text-field\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026quot;username-error\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-text-field name=\u0026quot;url\u0026quot; label=\u0026quot;Website:\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;url\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/gameface-text-field\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-text-field name=\u0026quot;email\u0026quot; label=\u0026quot;Email:\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;email\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/gameface-text-field\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button class=\u0026quot;form-element\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;submit\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Register\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/gameface-form-control\u0026gt;  As you can see some attributes are used to validate the user name. The url and email will be validated by default. We can add our custom validators using the methods exposed in the gameface-form-control component. Note: Custom validation should be added after the form control bundle is added to the page.\n// Custom validators should be set after the components library is added! const form = document.getElementById('custom-validation-form'); let serverError = false, serverNotReachable = false; //Will set custom validators for the form element with name attribute that has value - \u0026quot;username\u0026quot; form.setCustomValidators('username', { //There is no required attribute to the form element so we can add validation about it here valueMissing: { method: (element) =\u0026gt; !element.value, errorMessage: () =\u0026gt; 'The username is required! ' }, //We can change the default message on the 'tooShort' preset validator tooShort: { errorMessage: (element) =\u0026gt; `The username should have more than ${element.getAttribute('minlength')} symbols typed! `}, //Async validator that checks if the user is already added to the database by making a request to the server usernameExists: { method: async (element) =\u0026gt; { if (!element.value) return false; serverError = false; serverNotReachable = false; return new Promise((resolve) =\u0026gt; { const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', `http://localhost:3000/user-exists?username=${element.value}`); xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'); xhr.onload = (event) =\u0026gt; resolve(event.target.response === 'true'); xhr.onerror = () =\u0026gt; { serverError = true; return resolve(true) } xhr.timeout = 1000; xhr.ontimeout = () =\u0026gt; { serverNotReachable = true; return resolve(true) } xhr.send(); }) }, errorMessage: (element) =\u0026gt; { if (serverNotReachable) return 'Unable to reach the server! '; if (serverError) return 'Unable to reach the server due an error! '; return `\u0026quot;${element.value}\u0026quot; already used! Please use another one! `; } } }); //By default the error will be visible in a tooltip displayed next to the form element //We can change that behavior for the user name by selecting another element for this purpose form.setCustomDisplayErrorElement('username', '#username-error'); //We can set a custom validation of the form element with a custom method and a message form.setCustomValidators('url', { notStartingWithHttpProtocol: { method: (element) =\u0026gt; !element.value.startsWith('http://') \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !element.value.startsWith('https://'), errorMessage: () =\u0026gt; 'The url should start with \u0026quot;http://\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;https://\u0026quot;!' } }); form.setCustomValidators('email', { //We can remove the preset error message if the preset validator for email fails //That will also remove the tooltip because no error messages should be visible even if the check fails badEmail: { errorMessage: () =\u0026gt; '' } });  Accessing the XMLHttpRequest # An XMLHttpRequest is created when a form is submitted. It is helpful to access this XHR in case you need to check the status of the request, the response, or if you want to do something on success/error. You can access this request through the properties of the form control:\n\u0026lt;gameface-form-control id=\u0026quot;my-form\u0026quot; action=\u0026quot;http://localhost:3000/options\u0026quot; method=\u0026quot;POST\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026quot;text\u0026quot; name=\u0026quot;user\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;name\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button type=\u0026quot;submit\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Submit\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/gameface-form-control\u0026gt;  const form = document.getElementById('my-form'); const xhr = form.xhr; xhr.addEventListener('progress', () =\u0026gt; console.log('onProgress')); xhr.addEventListener('load', () =\u0026gt; console.log('load')); xhr.addEventListener('error', () =\u0026gt; console.log('error')); xhr.addEventListener('abort', () =\u0026gt; console.log('abort'));  "},{"id":25,"href":"/GameUIComponents/en/components/grid/","title":"Grid","content":"\nThe grid is part of the Gameface components suite.

Each attribute from the table can now be changed via JavaScript or by changing the attribute value of the gameface-rangeslider element. You can also add new attributes to the rangeslider runtime.

If the step attribute is used then setting the value is going to be pre-calculated to the next/previous value based on the step value. For example if the rangeslider has values from 0 to 100 and the step attribute value is 20 then setting value to 15 will be pre-calculated and set to 20. And if the value is 5 then will be set to 0.    When the rangeslider works with values array (the values attribute is set).\n You need to specify the newValue to be one from the values array. Otherwise it will be invalid and be set to the first value of the values array.

This behavior works as well when the slider has two handles enabled by the two-handles attribute.\nWhen the min or max are changed and if the grid of the rangeslider is enabled then it will be precalculated and re-rendered showing the new and true values of the slider.\nstep # The step attribute is not taking effect when the values attribute is used.\nYou can set step to the rangeslider by doing\nconst rangeslider = document.queryselector('gameface-rangeslider'); // either rangeslider.step = ${newValue}; // or rangeslider.setAttribute('step', ${newValue});  The newValue should always be a number.\nYou can get the step of the rangeslider by doing\nconst rangeslider = document.queryselector('gameface-rangeslider'); // either console.log(rangeslider.step); // or console.log(rangeslider.getAttribute('step'));  Behaviors # When the step is changed then the rangeslider will pre-calculate the current value to match the step conditions!

Alternatively, you can import them directly from node_modules:\nAvailable Modules # Along with the router comes the BrowserHistory and HashHistory package, a custom element called \u0026lt;gameface-route\u0026gt; and another custom element called \u0026lt;router-view\u0026gt;.\nThe Browser and Hash History # Both histories are a thin wrapper around the HTML5 history object. It provides methods that help the router keep better track of the state of history. The main difference between them is that the BrowserHistory will use the history object to control the current path and the HashHistory will use the history object in collaboration with the window.location.hash. When the router path has changed:\n BrowserHistory will change the path directly in the page URL (for example - from \u0026lsquo;C:/Test/\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;C:/Test/start\u0026rsquo;) HashHistory will append the hash symbol # to the current URL and then append the current router path (for example - from \u0026lsquo;C:/Test/index.html\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;C:/Test/index.html#/start\u0026rsquo;)  When to use the browser or hash history? # If you have a component that is linked with a route path and inside this component, you are referring assets relative to the main directory then it is a good idea to use the HashHistory instead the BrowserHistory because it will preserve the current working directory (that is the directory of the index page) and the assets will be linked correctly to the component.\nIn any other scenario, the BrowserHistory can be used.\nThe Route Element # The \u0026lt;gameface-route\u0026gt; custom element is a special link element that navigates to a specified page. It updates the BrowserHistory or HashHistory and as a result of this, the router updates the page.\nThe \u0026lt;gameface-route\u0026gt; has an attribute called to.

To do so define your style using css:\n.myActiveStyle { color: blue; }  And then add it as an attribute of the \u0026lt;gameface-route\u0026gt;:\n\u0026lt;gameface-route activeClass=\u0026quot;myActiveStyle\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nYou can apply the activeClass to multiple \u0026lt;gameface-route\u0026gt; elements by adding it to a container:\n\u0026lt;div activeClass=\u0026quot;myActiveStyle\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-route to=\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/gameface-route\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-route to=\u0026quot;/play\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Play\u0026lt;/gameface-route\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-route to=\u0026quot;/settings\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Settings\u0026lt;/gameface-route\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  If you have both activeClass on the wrapper an on some individual elements, those routes that don\u0026rsquo;t have own activeClass will inherit it from the parent element and those that have will use their own:\n\u0026lt;div activeClass=\u0026quot;green\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gameface-route to=\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/gameface-route\u0026gt; // will be green \u0026lt;gameface-route activeClass=\u0026quot;red\u0026quot; to=\u0026quot;/play\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Play\u0026lt;/gameface-route\u0026gt; // will be red \u0026lt;gameface-route to=\u0026quot;/settings\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Settings\u0026lt;/gameface-route\u0026gt; // will be green \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  If you don\u0026rsquo;t add activeClass to the wrapper div and the route element then the default light blue color will be used.\nThe RouterView Element # The \u0026lt;router-view\u0026gt; element is a placeholder for the components that will be rendered upon navigation. Put the \u0026lt;router-view\u0026gt; somewhere in the document:\n\u0026lt;gameface-route to=\u0026quot;/start-game\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Start Game\u0026lt;/gameface-route\u0026gt; \u0026lt;router-view\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/router-view\u0026gt;  Usage # You can import the Router, Route, BrowserHistory, and the HashHistory like this:\nimport { Router, Route, BrowserHistory, HashHistory } from 'coherent-gameface-router';  Route is a helper class that sets up the \u0026lt;gameface-route\u0026gt; element.\nThe router can not work without history, it is mandatory, so the first thing you need to do is to instantiate the history:\nconst myHistory = new BrowserHistory(); or const myHistory = new HashHistory();  The \u0026lt;gameface-route\u0026gt; also depends on the history. To initialize it do:\nRoute.use(myHistory);  The router is configured using an object of { \u0026lsquo;route\u0026rsquo;: \u0026lsquo;component-name | HTML\u0026rsquo; } pairs:\nconst config = { '/': 'home-page', '/start-game': 'start-game-page', '/heroes': 'heroes-page', }; You can also directly put the HTML that you want to be displayed: const config = { '/': '\u0026lt;div\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;', '/start-game': '\u0026lt;button\u0026gt;Start Game\u0026lt;button\u0026gt;', }; const router = new Router(config, myHistory);  And the second parameter is the history. The components in the configuration are the names of the custom element. When the router navigates to \u0026lsquo;/start-game\u0026rsquo; it will show the \u0026lt;start-game-page\u0026gt; element.\nRoute Params \u0026amp; Wildcard Navigation # Route Params # You can specify dynamic route parameters by using colon(:) in the path:\nconst config = { '/': 'home-page', '/start-game': 'start-game-page', '/heroes': 'heroes-page', '/heroes/:id': 'hero-component', }; const router = new Router(config, myHistory);  Now, if the router navigates to a route \u0026lsquo;/heroes/support\u0026rsquo;, the hero-component will receive an object with the route parameter and its current value: element.params = { id: 'support' }. The key used to save the route parameters is called params and the key for the parameter itself is the value after the :.\nA route configuration: \u0026lsquo;/start-game/:mode\u0026rsquo; and a route: \u0026lsquo;/start-game/ranked\u0026rsquo;\nwill pass a params object - { mode: \u0026lsquo;ranked\u0026rsquo; }.\nConfiguring a Wildcard Route # The wildcard route is used to specify which component to be displayed if the router doesn\u0026rsquo;t match any of the configured routes. It\u0026rsquo;s the missing 404 page displayed in websites when the server returns a \u0026ldquo;not found\u0026rdquo; response code - 404.\nTo configure the wildcard route use two asterisks(**) in the route:\nconst config = { '/': 'home-page', '/start-game': 'start-game-page', '/heroes': 'heroes-page', '/heroes/:id': 'hero-component', '**': 'not-found-page' }; const router = new Router(config, myHistory);  Nesting Routers # Sometimes if your UI has a lot of nesting levels, the routes can get long and it can become hard to read and understand them, especially if you have a long list of routes:\nconst config = { '/': 'home-page', '/start-game': 'start-game-page', '/heroes': 'heroes-page', '/heroes/:id': 'hero-page', '/heroes/:id/name': 'hero-name-page', '/heroes/:id/abilities': 'hero-abilities-page', '**': 'not-found-page' };  To avoid this, you can nest routers. Instead of specifying all of your routes in a single object, you can pass another router to a path and define the routes in the nested router relative to its parent. For the example above, we can create a heroesRouter which will handle all sub-routes of the heroes page:\nconst heroesRouter = new Router({ '/support': 'support-page', '/tanks': 'tanks-page', '/id:/name': 'hero-name-page' '/id:/abilities': 'hero-abilities-page' });  And we pass the heroesRouter to the main router:\nconst config = { '/': 'home-page', '/start-game': 'start-game-page', '/heroes': 'heroes-page', '/heroes/:id': heroesRouter, '**': 'not-found-page' };  Note, that only the top router requires the history instance, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to pass it to the nested router, they will receive it from the parent\nIntercepting Navigation # If you would like to prevent the navigation at some point, you can pass a onBeforeNavigation function that will be executed as the name suggests - before navigation. The onBeforeNavigation receives a callback as a first parameter. This is the navigation callback that was intercepted. To continue the navigation you must call the callback. The second parameter are the callback params:\nfunction preventNavigation (callback, params) =\u0026gt; { // do nothing - will not navigate // callback.apply(null, params); - will navigate }  And pass this callback to the router:\nconst router = new Router({}, myHistory, preventNavigation);  Just like the history, only the main router can receive a preventNavigation callback.\nManually updating the History # You can manually set new entries to the history stack. For example to setup the initial page:\nconst state = { current: '/', id: myHistory.currentRouteId }; const title = 'home'; myHistory.pushState(state, title, '/');  BrowserHistory.pushState and HashHistory.pushState accepts the same parameter the standard history.pushState accepts.\nDirectly updating the global history object will not trigger the router, if you want to navigate manually, use the BrowserHistory instance.\nYou can also use the history methods for manually updating the history like history.go, history.back, history.forward - This will work just in Chrome and not in GameFace!\nThis is all the information you need to setup the router.

Load the file in Gameface to see the gameface-scrollable-container.\nUsage with JavaScript: # If you wish to import the ScrollableContainer using JavaScript you can remove the script tag and import it like this:\nimport { ScrollableContainer } from 'coherent-gameface-scrollable-container';  or simply\nimport 'coherent-gameface-scrollable-container';  Note that this approach requires a module bundler like Webpack or Rollup to resolve the modules from the node_modules folder.\nManually showing and resizing the scrollbar # If the scrollable container is hidden, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to manually re-initialize the scrollbar once you show the scrollable container. The scrollable container has a method called showScrollBar. It accepts the scrollbar as an argument:\nconst scrollableContainer = document.querySelector('.guic-scrollable-container'); scrollableContainer.showScrollBar(scrollableContainer.scrollbar);  To resize the scrollbar call the resize function of the scrollbar and pass it the scrollable container as an argument:\nconst scrollableContent = scrollableContainer.querySelector('[name=\u0026quot;scrollable-content\u0026quot;]'); const scrollableContainer = document.querySelector('.guic-scrollable-container'); scrollableContainer.scrollbar.resize(scrollableContent);  The scrollableContainer has a method called shouldShowScrollbar which checks if the scrollable content is bigger than the scrollable container and if it is - it shows the scrollbar. Use this if you are not sure if you have to show the scrollbar:\nconst scrollableContainer = document.querySelector('.guic-scrollable-container'); scrollableContainer.shouldShowScrollbar();  If you need to hide the scrollbar - use the hideScrollBar method and pass it the scrollbar as an argument:\nconst scrollableContainer = document.querySelector('.guic-scrollable-container'); scrollableContainer.hideScrollBar(scrollableContainer.scrollbar);  Automatically showing and resizing the scrollbar # To automatically show, hide and resize the scrollbar set the automatic attribute to the \u0026lt;gameface-scrollable-container\u0026gt; element. This will initiate an observer that will monitor the scrollable-container for changes so that it can automatically re-adjust itself if it has to. Keep in mind that a mutationObserver can affect the performance of your UI. Consider manually re-adjusting the scrollbar if its content will change multiple tiles in a frame.\n\u0026lt;gameface-scrollable-container class=\u0026quot;scrollable-container-component fixed-width\u0026quot; automatic\u0026gt;\nAdd the Styles # \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;coherent-gameface-components-theme.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;style.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;node_modules/coherent-gameface-slider/styles/horizontal.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;node_modules/coherent-gameface-slider/styles/vertical.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt;  To overwrite the default styles, simply create new rules for the class names that you wish to change and include them after the default styles.\n"},{"id":42,"href":"/GameUIComponents/en/examples/scrollable-container/","title":"Scrollable container","content":"   body { background-color: transparent; } .guic-slider-component { width: 30px; } .guic-scrollable-container { background: none; width: 70%; height: 30vw; } .guic-vertical-slider-wrapper { height: 30vw; } .dynamic-content { display: none; } div.visible { display: block !important; } .fixed-width .guic-scrollable-container-wrapper { width: 35vw; height: 60vh; } .fixed-width .guic-vertical-slider-wrapper { height: 60vh; } .grid { display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .grid button { margin: 15px; padding: 10px; }    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
