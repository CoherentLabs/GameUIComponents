# Getting Started

The documentation is built using [Hugo - a framework for building websites](https://gohugo.io/).
You need to install it globally in order to be able to use it.
The installation steps vary depending on the operating system on which it will be used.
Refer to the [documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for more information.

After hugo was installed navigate to the documentation folder and run:

```
hugo server -t hugo-theme-techdoc
```

or

```
hugo server -D
```

to start a development server.

To fetch the theme run:

```
git submodule update --init
```
