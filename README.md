# Components for Game User Interface

This is a suite of custom elements designed specifically for Gameface. You can preview them by starting the demo. You can serve the root directory and open the demo.html file using an http-server of your choice. Or use the default setup in the package.

Navigate to the root directory and run:

    npm install

This will install a webpack server. After that run:

    npm run start:demo

This will serve the files on http://localhost:8080. Load that url in the Gameface player and preview the components.
You can change the port in the webpack.config.js file.
